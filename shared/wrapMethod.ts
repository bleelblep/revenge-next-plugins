/**
 * `instead` without `revenge.patcher`: replaces a method with a plain function that hands `hook`
 * the call's args and the method as it was, with the receiver as `this` (the same shape as an
 * `instead` hook, so a `function (this, args, original)` body moves over unchanged).
 *
 * ## Why not the patcher's `instead`
 *
 * Two `instead` hooks on one method can recurse forever: each saves the method as it was when it
 * was added as its "original", and if that was already a patcher proxy (because some plugin's
 * `before` or `after` came first), the last hook in the chain calls back into the first. Hit for
 * real on `RowManager.prototype.generate`, which Custom Timestamps and Ghost Log NG both changed
 * this way while half the repo `before`/`after`-hooks it ("Maximum call stack size exceeded" on the
 * chat screen; docs/debugging/api-contracts.md, "Two instead hooks on one method can recurse forever").
 *
 * A plain function is not a proxy, so a patcher hook added after it saves real code, and one added
 * before it is simply what it calls. Safe in any start order. Send Tweaks' `lib/wrap.ts` is the
 * same idea for a before-only hook.
 *
 * ## Undoing it
 *
 * If the method is still this wrapper, the original is put back. If something has wrapped it since,
 * removing it would drop their hook too, so the wrapper stays and just passes calls through.
