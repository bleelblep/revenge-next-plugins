/**
 * Putting a local image into the message box as an attachment, the way picking a photo does.
 * Shared by every plugin that attaches files (Sekai Stickers, Pocket Browser).
 *
 * Nothing is sent: the file waits above the message box, where it can be removed, captioned or sent
 * with the normal send button.
 *
 * ## Why not just call Discord's upload functions
 *
 * `actions/UploadAttachmentActionCreators.tsx` and `modules/media_keyboard/native/
 * MediaKeyboardUtils.tsx` load lazily: only once the photo picker has been opened. The plugins used
 * to load them themselves with Metro's `__r` by module IDs listed per Discord build, and every new
 * build broke that ("Discord's upload functions weren't found").
 *
 * What they do is small (350.4 bundle, read from the bytecode 2026-10-18):
 *
 * - `cropResultToUploadItem({ path, mime, width, height })` returns `{ id: uniqueId(path), uri,
 *   originalUri, mimeType, width, height, filename, platform: UploadPlatform.REACT_NATIVE }`, where
 *   `uri` and `originalUri` are the path with `file://` added and `filename` its last part.
 * - `addFile({ file, channelId, draftType, allowOptimization })` converts the image first if
 *   `itemNeedsImagePreConversion` (HEIC and the like; PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP don't), then
 *   dispatches `{ type: 'UPLOAD_ATTACHMENT_ADD_FILES', channelId, files: [file], draftType,
 *   allowOptimization }` on the Flux dispatcher.
 * - `UploadPlatform.REACT_NATIVE` and `DraftType.ChannelMessage` are both 0.
 *
 * So Discord's own functions are used when Discord has loaded them -- that keeps Strip Metadata's
 * hook on `addFile` in the path -- and otherwise the item is built here and the same action is
 * dispatched directly. The dispatcher is always loaded, so this works on any build.
 *
 * Call only from functions: `revenge.*` is read lazily (docs/porting-rules.md rule 1).
