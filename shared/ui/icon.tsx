/**
 * A leading icon for a settings row, by icon name. Shared by every plugin's `js/ui/icon.tsx`.
 *
 * Icon naming splits in two: older icons are *registry assets* resolved by `getAssetIdByName`,
 * while Discord's newer set (the `redesign/generated/*.tsx` modules) are generated React
 * *components* that only `lookupGeneratedIconComponent` can see. Each name is tried as an asset and
 * then as a component before moving on to the next name. First hit wins; if every name misses, the
 * row gets no icon rather than a broken image.
 *
 * The per-name order is the fix this file exists for. Fourteen plugins used to try *every* name as
 * an asset first and only then as components, which let a generic asset fallback at the end of the
 * list (`PuzzlePieceIcon`, `ic_settings`) beat a real component icon listed ahead of it.
 *
 * Call from inside a component's render: `revenge.*` is read here, so module scope is out
 * (docs/porting-rules.md rule 1).

 * Other names to try for an icon Discord has removed. There is no standalone sparkle in 348:
