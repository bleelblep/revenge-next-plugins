 *
 * `label` names the field (the row's label), `title` is an optional group heading, and the
 * explanation goes inside the row as muted text, so don't also pass `label` / `description` to the
 * TextInput. Error text stays on the TextInput (`status` + `errorMessage`).

 * Not for search boxes above a list or fields inside an alert dialog: those stay bare.
