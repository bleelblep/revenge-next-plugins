/**
 * Slash commands and "only you can see this" replies, shared by every plugin that has a command.
 * Each plugin's `js/lib/commands.ts` calls `createCommands` once and re-exports the result, so its
 * own files keep importing from there. Fix it here, not there.
 *
 * Every plugin bundles its own copy of this file, so the state below is per plugin, not global.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Classic Revenge and Vendetta shipped `vendetta.commands.registerCommand`. Revenge Next exposes
 * nothing equivalent, so this reimplements the small part of it a plugin actually needs.
 *
 * ## How Discord's own commands work
 *
 * Built-in commands — the ones that are not from a bot, like /shrug and /tableflip — live in a
 * plain array exported as `BUILT_IN_COMMANDS` from
 * `modules/application_commands/ApplicationCommandBuiltIns.tsx`. Pushing a well-formed entry into
 * that array is all registration is, and Discord then runs its `execute` locally on send.
 *
 * ## Why this waits rather than looks
 *
 * The command modules are not initialized at `start()`, so a one-shot `lookupModule` finds
 * nothing (porting rule 3). `registerCommand` records what you want and the entry is pushed the
 * moment the module shows up. Two routes are tried, better one first:
 *
 * 1. `getModuleWithImportedPath`, which resolves a module by the path Discord's own bundle
 *    records — a map lookup plus a subscription, with no filter `max` to poison.
 * 2. A `lookupModules` + `waitForModules` pair on `withProps('BUILT_IN_COMMANDS')`, in case the
 *    path moves in a later Discord build.
 *
 * Whichever answers first wins, and `registryStatus()` says which.
 *
 * ## Clientside replies
 *
 * `showClientMessage` hands a fabricated message to the client's own receive path: it renders
 * like a real one in the channel you are reading and no request is made. `flags: 64` is
 * EPHEMERAL, which makes Discord render its own "Only you can see this" notice.
