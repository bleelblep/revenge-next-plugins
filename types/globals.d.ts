// Globals the Revenge Next host injects into an external plugin's scope.
//
// These mirror revenge-bundle-next's own `types/globals.consumers.ts` verbatim, and everything
// they reference comes from `types/next/` -- the *generated* type surface from that repo
// (`bun types` -> `dist/types`), vendored here. See types/next/README.md.
//
// This replaced a hand-written `types/revenge.d.ts` that had been reverse-engineered from built
// plugin output and corrected against crash logs. Several of its guesses were wrong
// (`revenge.discord.common.chroma`, `.moment`, `revenge.utils.react.findInReactTree`,
// `filters.withStoreName`), each found on-device rather than at compile time.
