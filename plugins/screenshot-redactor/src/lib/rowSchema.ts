/**
 * The chat bridge wire format, taken from Discord's own serializers rather than guessed.
 *
 * Everything the message list draws crosses the JS/native boundary exactly once, as the JSON
 * argument to `DCDChatManager.updateRows`. That JSON is deserialized on the native side by
 * kotlinx.serialization classes whose generated `$$serializer`s name every field explicitly, and
 * those classes are readable in the jadx decompile of the shipped APK:
 *
 *   com/discord/chat/bridge/row/RowSerializer.java      — the row discriminator
 *   com/discord/chat/bridge/row/MessageRow$$serializer  — the row envelope
 *   com/discord/chat/bridge/Message$$serializer         — every field on a message
 *   com/discord/chat/bridge/referencedmessage/…         — the reply preview
 *
 * This matters because the plugin's previous field lists came from `dumpRowShape` — a one-shot
 * dump of a single row that had actually been scrolled past. That can only ever report fields
 * that happened to be populated on that row, which is exactly how `clanTag`/`clanBadgeUrl` went
 * unnoticed for fifteen releases. A schema read from the deserializer lists every field that
 * *can* be present, whether or not this account has ever received one.
 *
 * Schema below is from Discord Android 337.10.

 * the native side will *accept*, which overlaps with but is not the same as what JS actually puts
 * on a row. It named `tagText`/`tagType`/`connectionsRoleTag`, which on a real device are
 * `null`/`undefined` on every message seen — and it omitted the three fields that are actually

 * The lesson is not "the decompile was useless" — it answered the bridge protocol and the DM

 * *device dump* is authoritative for what is on the object. For "which fields carry an identity
 * right now", the dump wins. The `tag*` names are kept because they are real fields that a future

 * member list, profile sheets and the autocomplete — and does nothing at all for a mention inside
 * a message, because by the time a message reaches the screen its mentions are already text.

 * (`PluginGeneratedSerialDescriptor("text", …, 1)`, one `content` string). So the name is baked
 * into the row JSON on the JS side and then lives in Kotlin like every other row field.
 *
 * Two consequences:
 *
 * - **It redacts here or nowhere.** There is no resolver left to hook downstream of this.
 * - **It comes free with the repaint.** Mentions are rewritten by the same pass over the same
 *   object as the username and avatar, so they follow the toggle exactly as those do.
