/**
 * Making the React surfaces re-resolve names.
 *
 * The single-DM header resolves its name inside a `useStateFromStores([RelationshipStore,
 * UserStore], selector, [userId])` (read from the shipped bundle). An emit on either store
 * makes the memoized selector re-run — so once the resolvers are hooked, nudging those stores
 * is all it takes to hide or restore the name on toggle.
 *
 * The group-DM header is a different component. The plugin can't read its subscriptions from
 * the minified bytecode, and neither the targeted stores nor the full callback sweep repaints it
 * immediately. Its redacted names appear only after a channel refresh or switch. The sweep is
 * retained for other resolver-backed surfaces and future Discord builds where the subscription
 * path may differ.
 *
 * `RelationshipStore` is where a friend nickname comes from and is the first thing the header
 * asks; `UserStore` supplies the object for the `getName` fallback. The rest of the targeted
 * list covers the member list, profile sheets, and other resolver-backed surfaces.

 * — the memoized hook the headers use — subscribes through `addReactChangeListener`, so
 * invoking the react callback set re-runs it *directly*, whether or not the store's own
 * `emitChange` exists or decides a no-op isn't worth broadcasting.
