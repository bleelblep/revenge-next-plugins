/**
 * The avatar beside a name, on every surface that isn't a message row.
 *
 * ## Why the DM header name redacted and the face next to it didn't
 *
 * Because they are resolved by two entirely different mechanisms, and this plugin only had one of
 * them. Traced through the shipped bundle (porting rule 5), the header avatar's path is:
 *
 * ```
 * PrivateChannelHeader                       fn 75860
 *   → renderUserAvatar(user, status, …)      fn 75956, ChannelHeaderShared.tsx
 *     → <UserAvatar user={user} … />         fn 75946
 *       → <Avatar user={user} size={…} />    fn 92365
 *         → user.getAvatarSource(guildId, animate, size)      ← UserRecord.prototype method
 *           → getAnimatableSourceWithFallback(animate, cb)
 *             → cb → AvatarUtils.getUserAvatarSource(user, animate, size)
 * ```
 *
 * Nothing in that chain touches a row, a name resolver or a Flux store. `Avatar` is handed the
 * whole `user` record and derives the image itself, so the header name going through
 * `RelationshipStore.getNickname` (which `patches/dmHeader.ts` hooks) said nothing at all about
 * the avatar sitting next to it. Redaction covered message-row avatars because those arrive as an
 * `avatarURL` **string** on the flat row object, which `lib/rowSchema.ts` rewrites; the header
 * never produces one.
 *
 * This is the third bug in this plugin with the same shape — `getNickname` was a store method,
 * `getAvatarSource` is a record method, and both were being looked for as module exports. The
 * useful generalisation: **if a surface is handed a record rather than a string, the string is
 * being computed somewhere this plugin isn't looking.**
 *
 * ## Where the hook goes
 *
 * On `utils/AvatarUtils.tsx`, not on `UserRecord.prototype`. The record's methods reach the utils
 * through a property read on the required namespace at call time —
 *
 * ```
 * GetById reg3, reg4, 'getUserAvatarSource'          // inside UserRecord.prototype.getAvatarSource
 * GetById reg3, reg4, 'getGuildMemberAvatarURLSimple'
 * ```
 *
 * — so patching the export is visible to it, and to every other caller in the app at the same
 * time: the member list, profile sheets, facepiles, the mention autocomplete. Patching the record
 * prototype would need an instance to reach it from and would cover strictly less.
 *
 * The same module reached by the same means as the name resolvers, and for the same reasons:
 * `revenge.discord.utils.finders.getModuleWithImportedPath` is uncapped, uncached and
 * self-unsubscribing. See the header of `patches/displayName.ts` for why the `getModules` +
 * `withProps` route silently installs nothing here.

 * avatar, userId, canAnimate, size })` takes a descriptor, which is why `lib/userArgs.ts` has to
 * find a subject two ways.
