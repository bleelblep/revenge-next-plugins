/**
 * Fuck Squares: undoes the redesign's squares, one at a time, each behind its own switch.
 *
 * Ground-up rewrite (1.0.0): JS only. The old version stacked five layers (a native hook cutting
 * every server picture as it drew, native size heuristics across all of Discord, a token override,
 * two JS patches) that fought each other and guessed by size app-wide. Now there is one
 * mechanism: each target names its components by module path (lib/targets.ts), the component's
 * render output gets re-rounded by a rule scoped to that component (lib/rounder.ts, lib/hook.ts),
 * and the server list's selection frame gets its own `circle` prop back (patches/selectionFrame.ts).
 *
 * Patches go in at startup. The server list reads its components once when it mounts, so a change
 * applies to lists built afterwards; the settings page asks for a reload.
