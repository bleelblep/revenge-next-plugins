/**
 * Re-rounds the corners in one component's render output.
 *
 * The redesign kept Discord's shared corner tokens and hardcoded smaller corners per component
 * instead, usually assembled from several style pieces, so no single style object or token can be
 * patched. What's always there is the element tree a component returns: every view's final `style`
 * is on it. So each target component gets an after-hook on its render, and its output is walked
 * with a rule that says what corner a view of this size should have. The rule sees only that
 * component's views, so "a square up to 40 dp is a circle" can't leak into anything else, and if a
 * component is renamed or removed only that target stops working.
 *
 * The tree is copied, never mutated: React Compiler caches element trees between renders, and
 * editing a cached tree in place is how the old You bar patch broke other renders.
 *
 * Some views only exist inside components a module doesn't export (the send button on 350.2+ is
 * `ChatInputSendButton` -> TransitionGroup -> an inner function that draws the actual button). A
 * render hook on the export sees only the outer elements, so `roundTree` also replaces the type of
 * any function component it meets with a wrapper that renders the original and re-rounds what it
 * returns, a few levels down. Wrappers are cached per original so React keeps the same identity.
