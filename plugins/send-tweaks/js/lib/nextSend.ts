/**
 * A one-off instruction for the very next message, set from the send button's long-press sheet.
 *
 * The sheet does not send anything itself: it records what the next send should do, then presses
 * Discord's own send button, so the message goes out through the normal path (draft, reply, pending
 * attachments and all) and the send hook in `patches/outgoing.ts` picks the instruction up.
 *
 * It expires after a few seconds. If that press never reaches `sendMessage` (a slash command, or a
 * path this plugin does not hook), the instruction must not wait around and land on some later,
 * unrelated message.
