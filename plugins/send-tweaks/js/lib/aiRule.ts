/**
 * Writing a rule from a plain-language description, through AI Core.
 *
 * Only reachable when AI Core is installed (`getAi()`); the Ready-made screens hide the whole
 * section otherwise. One call per rule, from AI Core's shared daily budget. Only the description is
 * sent -- never a message.
 *
 * ## Why the model also writes examples
 *
 * Model-written regex is often almost right. So the model returns two or three example inputs with
 * the output it expects, and those are run through the rule here, on the device, with the same
 * `applyRules` that sending uses. The user sees each pass or fail before deciding to add the rule,
 * and nothing is added automatically. The rule also goes through `compileRule`, so the freeze guard
 * and invalid-pattern checks apply exactly as they do to an imported rule.
 *
 * A link rule's examples are single URLs, because that is all a link rule ever sees; a text rule's
 * are short messages.

const SHARED = `You write one find-and-replace rule for a Discord client plugin, from the user's description.
Reply with a single JSON object and nothing else:
{"name": string, "find": string, "replace": string, "regex": boolean, "caseSensitive": boolean, "wholeWord": boolean,
 "examples": [{"input": string, "output": string}, ...]}

Rules:
- "find" is plain text, or a JavaScript regular expression when "regex" is true. Do not include slashes or flags.
- The rule always replaces every match. "caseSensitive": false matches any capitalisation.
- In "replace", $1, $2 refer to captured groups (regex only).
- Never put a repeated group inside another repeat, such as (a+)+ or (\\w+\\s?)*: the plugin refuses them.
- Do not use lookbehind ((?<= or (?<!); lookahead is fine.
- "wholeWord" only applies to plain-text rules; set it false for regex.
- Give 2 or 3 examples, including one the rule must leave unchanged, with the exact expected output.
- "name" is a short label, like "Twitter to fxtwitter".`

const LINKS = `${SHARED}
- This is a LINK rule. It runs on one URL at a time, after tracking parameters have been removed, and
  never on the rest of the message. Every example input and output is a single full URL.
- Typical use: swapping a site for a service that embeds it better in Discord. Only use a replacement
  domain you are confident still exists; say which service it is in "name".`

const TEXT = `${SHARED}
- This is a TEXT rule. It runs on the words of a message; links, mentions, custom emoji, timestamps
  and code blocks are never touched, so do not try to match them. Example inputs are short messages.`
