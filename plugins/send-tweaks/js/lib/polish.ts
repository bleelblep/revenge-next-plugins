/**
 * Polish wording: small tidy-ups to the words of a message, done on the phone with no AI.
 *
 * - Apostrophes: "dont" becomes "don't", "im" becomes "I'm".
 * - Capitals: the first letter of each sentence, and "i" on its own.
 * - Full stop: one at the end of the message, when it ends in a letter or number.
 *
 * The idea comes from Equicord's PolishWording; this is written for Send Tweaks and shares no
 * code with it. Unlike that plugin it leaves out contractions that are also ordinary words --
 * "ill", "wed", "shed", "its", "were", "well", "hell", "lets" -- because a wrong fix there changes
 * what was said.
 *
 * Runs from `transform` with links, mentions, emoji, timestamps and code held aside as
 * placeholders, so none of them can be capitalised or punctuated. No lookbehind or `\p{}`: neither is proven on Hermes.
