 * Leaving code alone.

 * value, a curl command, a bug report quoting the URL that broke. Cleaning it or running a text
 * replacement over it would change what the person meant to show. So both transforms run only
 * over the prose between code spans.
 *
 * Fenced blocks (```) are matched first, then double-backtick inline code (``has a ` inside``),
 * then single-backtick inline code -- which Discord lets run across a line break, so the pattern
 * does too. Matching in that order keeps a backtick inside a longer span from opening a shorter one.
