/**
 * Scrolling that the picker's sheet knows about.
 *
 * The expression picker sits in Discord's keyboard sheet (modules/keyboard/native/
 * PortalKeyboardBottomSheet.tsx, built on @gorhom/bottom-sheet). The sheet's own drag-to-close
 * gesture only gives way to lists it has been told about -- gorhom's `BottomSheetScrollView` /
 * `BottomSheetFlatList`, which Discord's emoji and sticker lists use. A plain React Native
 * ScrollView isn't one, so a drag that starts on empty space between rows (where no row's own
 * touch handling claims it) went to the sheet, which tried to close.
 *
 * So the History list uses gorhom's versions, found by their exports when first drawn.
 * They throw outside a gorhom sheet, so each sits behind an error boundary that falls back to the
 * plain React Native list, which scrolls fine and only loses that hand-off.
