	{
		version: '0.4.5',
		date: '2026-10-18',
		title: 'Badges load on their own again',
		changes: [
			"Fixed badges only showing after you opened someone's profile: one profile request that never answered stalled every other one for the rest of the session. Requests now time out and retry.",
			'Badges in a busy channel load several times faster: three profiles load at once, newest messages first.',
		],
	},
	{
		version: '0.4.4',
		date: '2026-10-18',
		title: 'Account pronouns in servers',
		changes: [
			"In servers, pronouns set on someone's account now show when their server profile has none. Before, a loaded server profile stopped the account profile from ever being fetched, which hid your own pronouns too.",
		],
	},
	{
		version: '0.4.3',
		date: '2026-10-18',
		title: 'Better at spotting real pronouns',
		changes: [
			'"Only real pronouns" now knows which pronoun words are also everyday words or parts of names (shi, ki, kit, fox, star, cat, one, her, his, it and more). On their own or inside a name they no longer make a badge; written as a set like it/its, cat/cats or shi/hir they still do.',
			'Slashes written as \\ or other slash-like characters count, so she\\her shows as she/her.',
			'Brackets and "but" no longer hide the pronouns before them: "any (ask)" shows any.',
			'With any/all turned off, he/any still shows he.',
			'PronounDB answers are no longer run through the name check, so its "it" still shows.',
		],
	},
	{
		version: '0.4.2',
		date: '2026-10-18',
		title: 'Names are not pronouns',
		changes: [
			'"Only real pronouns" no longer picks a pronoun word out of a name or sentence: "Emperor Shi Hao" shows no badge instead of "Shi". Sets written with a slash, like he/him, still count anywhere in the field.',
		],
	},
	{
		version: '0.4.1',
		date: '2026-10-15',
		title: 'Settings that fit in',
		changes: [
			'A shorter settings index with People, Pronoun sources and Badge colour pages.',
			'Person entries now reveal separate edit, refresh and confirmed removal actions.',
			'Colour editors identify the global colour, default colour and selected person. Adding an existing person preserves their colour.',
		],
	},
	{
		version: '0.4.0',
		date: '2026-10-15',
		title: 'People and colour pages, PronounDB toggle',
		changes: [
			'Whose pronouns show, the lists, and pronouns you set now live on their own People page.',
			'Badge colour now has its own page too, with a new choice: one colour for everyone, or a colour per person with a default for everyone else.',
			'New "Also check PronounDB" switch turns pronoundb.org lookups off entirely, so nothing is sent there if you only want Discord\'s own pronouns.',
			'A pronouns-you-set entry can now be edited in place instead of only cleared and redone.',
			'Look up again on the People page re-asks PronounDB for the people on your list, skipping the cache.',
		],
	},
	{
		version: '0.3.2',
		date: '2026-10-14',
		title: 'Discord 351.2',
		changes: [

		],
	},
	{
		version: '0.3.1',
		date: '2026-10-13',
		title: 'Badge colour',

			'The Try it box is gone.',
		],
	},
	{
		version: '0.3.0',
		date: '2026-10-13',
		title: 'Cleaner pronouns, lists that stick',
		changes: [
			'New Only real pronouns setting: shows just the pronouns from a profile and hides bios, ages and jokes. Neopronouns count, Any and All are your choice, and you can allow extra words.',
			'Show and hide lists now save properly, even if you change them before restarting Discord.',
			'Lists show each person’s pronouns, you can add people by user ID, and clear a list in one go.',
			'Pronouns you set yourself are listed in settings, where you can clear them.',
		],
	},

		date: '2026-10-11',
		title: 'Pronouns load on their own',
		changes: [

		version: '0.2.0',
		date: '2026-10-11',
		title: 'Pick whose pronouns show',

		version: '0.1.1',
		date: '2026-10-11',
		title: 'Badges appear on their own',
		changes: [
