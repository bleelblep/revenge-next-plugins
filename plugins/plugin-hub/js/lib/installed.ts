/**
 * What is installed, when Revenge will say.
 *
 * ## Why this needs Developer Mode
 *
 * The plugin API Revenge Next gives a plugin exposes no list of other plugins -- `plugins` on the
 * unscoped API is `constants` and a version formatter, nothing more
 * (`lib/plugins/src/apis/plugins.ts` in revenge-bundle-next). The registry itself, `pList`, is only
 * reachable through the hidden API, which the internal "Developer Mode" plugin
 * (`revenge.api.hidden`) attaches as `unscoped.hidden` -- and that is off by default on release
 * builds and switched on from Revenge's settings.
 *
 * So discovery is optional by construction. When the hidden API is there, this lists everything.
 * When it is not, `listInstalled` returns undefined and the pages say why, while the hub itself
 * carries on working from the snapshots in storage (see `Entry` in `types.ts`).
 *
 * The manifest declares `revenge.api.hidden` as an **optional** dependency. That documents the
 * relationship and gets the hub started after Developer Mode when both are on, without making
 * Developer Mode a requirement -- a required dependency would keep it switched on permanently,
 * and while it is on the hidden API is visible to every installed plugin, not just this one.
 *
 * Read lazily, at render time, never at module scope (porting rule 1) -- and because Developer
 * Mode can be switched on mid-session, which a value captured at start would miss.
