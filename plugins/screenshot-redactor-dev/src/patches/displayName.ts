/**
 * Redacting names *wherever the client resolves them* — inline `@mentions`, the member list, the
 * profile sheet, the mention autocomplete — rather than one patch per surface.
 *
 * All of those go through one module, and after five releases of guessing we now know which one
 * by name rather than by shape.
 *
 * ## The module is `utils/UserUtils.tsx`
 *
 * Read out of the shipped Hermes bundle (porting rule 5), not probed for. Its factory ends with a
 * `fileFinishedImporting('utils/UserUtils.tsx')` followed by the export assignments:
 *
 * ```
 * PutById exports, 'nameFromUser'      PutById exports, 'getUserTag'
 * PutById exports, 'getName'           PutById exports, 'useUserTag'
 * PutById exports, 'useName'           PutById exports, 'getGlobalName'
 * PutById exports, 'getFormattedName'
 * ```
 *
 * Two things follow, and between them they explain why 0.3.0–0.18.5 hooked exactly one resolver:
 *
 * 1. **There is one module that matters and it has a stable name.** `withProps('getName')`
 *    matches 26 modules on device because `getName` is an unremarkable export name; 25 of them
 *    are unrelated, and on most of those it isn't even a function. Filtering by property name was
 *    always going to be a lottery.
 * 2. **`getNickname` is not in it.** It never was — it is a Flux store method, which is what
 *    `patches/dmHeader.ts` exists to handle. The old candidate list mixed the two families
 *    together and reported "resolver not found" for something that was never a module export.
 *
 * ## Why `getModuleWithImportedPath` and not `getModules`
 *
 * `revenge.discord.utils.finders.getModuleWithImportedPath` looks the module up in the import
 * tracker's `Map<path, id>` and, failing that, subscribes to `fileFinishedImporting`. No filter,
 * no result cache, no `max`, and it unsubscribes itself once the path resolves — imported paths
 * are unique, so there is nothing to disambiguate.
 *
 * That last point is the actual fix. `getModules(filter, cb, { max: 25 })` shares one `max`
 * counter between its lookup half and its wait half: the lookup runs first over every
 * already-initialized module and decrements `max` per match, and the counter it then hands to
 * `waitForModules` is whatever is left — zero, if 25 unrelated modules matched first.
 * `withProps('getName')` matches 26. So the subscription that was meant to catch
 * `utils/UserUtils.tsx` when the chat screen initialized it had already been spent on modules
 * whose `getName` isn't a function, and the callback returned silently on each. That is the
 * "`getModules` and `lookupModules` do not agree" entry in docs/porting-rules.md: they agree
 * fine, the subscription just never survived the lookup.
 *
 * `useUserTag` only ever landed because it is a rare enough export name that the 25 slots were
 * not exhausted before the real module turned up.

/**
 * The exports worth hooking.
 *
 * `nameFromUser` is the primitive the rest are built on, but hooking it does **not** cover them:
 * `getName` calls it through a closure binding rather than through the exports object, so a patch
 * on the export is invisible to it. Every resolver reached from outside the module therefore has
 * to be hooked individually; `nameFromUser` is listed for the callers that use it directly.
 *
 * `getNickname` is deliberately absent — see the note above.
