/**
 * The user-facing wording about stale placeholders, in one place.
 *
 * Two surfaces can flip the toggle — the settings switch and the message long-press row — and

 * path and quietly missing from the other.
 *
 * Plain strings, no `revenge.*`, so module scope is safe.

/**
 * ## Why switching off does not always restore everything at once
 *
 * The patches stay installed and gate per call, so the *rewriting* stops the instant the toggle
 * flips. What can survive is everything the client already computed while redaction was armed:
 *
 * - **Rows already drawn.** They live in Kotlin once they cross `DCDChatManager.updateRows`, and
 *   JS only pushes rows that changed — see "The chat bridge" in the README. Reopening the channel
 *   is what makes JS send a complete list.
 * - **Memoized resolvers.** The DM header computes its name inside
 *   `useStateFromStores([...], selector, [userId])`, and avatar sources go through Discord's own
 *   `memoizedImageSource`. `lib/nudge.ts` pokes the stores the header subscribes to, which
 *   handles the common case but is not a guarantee for every surface.
 * - **Cached images.** The placeholder avatar is a real URL that React Native has loaded and
 *   cached like any other.
 * - **The nickname workaround.** While armed, `getNickname` answers "yes, User 3" for everyone
 *   (see `patches/dmHeader.ts`). Anything that read that and held onto it keeps holding it.
 *
 * None of that is redaction still running — it is a picture of redaction, held in caches this
 * plugin does not own and cannot invalidate from JS. A full app reload clears all of them at
 * once, which is worth saying plainly rather than leaving someone to wonder whether the toggle
 * worked.
