/**
 * Counters for working out *why* a surface isn't being redacted.
 *
 * "Works in chat but not DMs" has several possible causes that look identical from the outside:
 * DM rows might never reach the hook (a second RowManager we never patched), or reach it and be
 * skipped (an unexpected `rowType`, a missing author), or be redacted correctly and simply not
 * repainted (the virtualised list's row cache). These counters tell those apart at a glance.
 *
 * Plain module state, no `revenge.*`, so module scope is safe. Nothing here is persisted and
 * nothing here records an identity — only counts and row type numbers.
