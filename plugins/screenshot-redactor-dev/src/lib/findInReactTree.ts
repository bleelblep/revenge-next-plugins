// `revenge.utils.react.findInReactTree` doesn't exist -- see docs/porting-rules.md rule 4. This

// `props.children` (single node or array) recursively for the first match.
//
// Also finds arrays, which is what the action-sheet patch needs -- the row groups live in a
// plain array rather than behind an element, so `predicate` is given every node including
// arrays and their entries.
