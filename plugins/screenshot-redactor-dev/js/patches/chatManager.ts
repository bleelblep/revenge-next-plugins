/**
 * Redaction at the JS/native boundary.
 *
 * `DCDChatManager.updateRows(tag, rowsJSON, isLoadingAtTop)` is the single point every message
 * that reaches the screen passes through — `com/discord/chat/ChatModule.java` exposes only it and
 * `clearRows`, and both are `@ReactMethod`s on the plain native module object. Redacting here
 * rather than at `RowManager.prototype.generate` has four consequences worth stating:
 *
 * 1. **It repaints.** The rows can be mirrored and pushed back (see `lib/chatRows.ts`), which is
 *    what makes the toggle take effect without switching channels.
 * 2. **It catches rows generated before we were listening.** A `generate` hook can only ever see
 *    rows made after it was installed.
 * 3. **It is downstream of every other plugin.** Show Tag appends the real `@handle` at
 *    `generate`; whatever it appends is still in this JSON, and gets overwritten here. That
 *    settles README open question 4 — the `HookPriority` guess on the `generate` hook no longer
 *    decides anything.
 * 4. **It is not `generate`.** No contention with custom-timestamps' `instead`, and no exposure
 *    to the two-`instead` recursion bug (porting rule 2), because nothing else in this repo
 *    patches a native module.
 *
 * `before`, not `instead`: the work is a rewrite of `args[1]` in place, and this plugin has never
 * used `instead`.

/**
 * Finding the native module, which is NOT reliably there when `start()` runs.

 * early (porting rule 1 — the same trap as `getAssetIdByName` at module scope, one lifecycle
 * stage later). `lib/reload.ts` in hide-servers-drawer gets away with the identical access only
 * because it runs from a button press, long after start.
 *

 * identified by `hostRef.__nativeTag` rather than a numeric tag argument, so the ref has to be
 * remembered per tag to push anything back.
 *
 * Confirmed on device by hooking it and reading one batch: 21 rows of the same
