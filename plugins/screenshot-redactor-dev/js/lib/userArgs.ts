/**
 * Working out *which person* a resolver call is about, from its arguments.
 *
 * Discord's shared resolvers take their subject in three different shapes, and every one of them
 * has cost this plugin a release:
 *
 * - a **user object** — `getName(user)`, `getUserAvatarURL(user, …)`
 * - a **bare id string** — `RelationshipStore.getNickname(userId)`, which is what let the DM
 *   header survive six attempts (`patches/dmHeader.ts` documents that one in full)
 * - an **options object carrying `userId`** — `getGuildMemberAvatarURLSimple({ guildId, avatar,
 *   userId, canAnimate, size })`
 *
 * Locating the subject by shape rather than by position is deliberate: the same helper is called
 * as `f(user)`, `f(guildId, user)` and `f(guildId, channelId, user)` depending on the call site.
 *
 * Pure logic, no `revenge.*`, so module scope is safe here (porting rule 1 is about reading the
 * lazy API proxies early, not about having module state at all).
