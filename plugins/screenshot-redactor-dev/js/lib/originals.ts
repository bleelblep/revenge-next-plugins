/**
 * What each message looked like before `patches/rowManager.ts` redacted it.
 *
 * The chat mirror (`lib/chatRows.ts`) must hold *unredacted* rows: turning redaction off repaints
 * from it. But when a chat is opened with redaction already on, `RowManager.generate` redacts each
 * row as Discord builds it, before the `updateRows` hook ever sees it -- so the mirror was filled
 * with placeholders, and switching off repainted the placeholders (0.27.x: "enable on another
 * screen, open the chat, toggle off: names stay censored"). Enabling inside an open chat worked,
 * because those rows had been mirrored before redaction started.
 *
 * So the row hook records a copy of each message just before redacting it, and the mirror swaps
 * it back in by message id. Pure data, no `revenge.*`, so module scope is fine.
