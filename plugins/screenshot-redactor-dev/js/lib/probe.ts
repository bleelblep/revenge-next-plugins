/**
 * A one-shot sweep of Metro's initialized modules, printed to the console.
 *
 * Four releases were spent guessing module names one per round, because the only channel back
 * from the device was a sentence in the settings page. `console.log` reaches `adb logcat` under
 * the `ReactNativeJS` tag, which is enough bandwidth to just *look*.
 *
 * Debug-only, off by default, and it never logs a value — only module ids and export key names.
 * Nothing here can print a username.
 *
 * ## One line per hit, on purpose
 *
 * The previous version batched hits twenty to a `console.log`. Only the *first* line of a
 * multi-line log carries the `ReactNativeJS` tag, so every continuation line is dropped by any
 * tag or prefix filter — the sweep appeared to find 79 candidate modules and print none of them.
 * That is porting rule 5's own warning, walked straight into by the tool written to satisfy it.
 * Every line below is its own call.
 */

/**
 * Metro ids are dense small integers. There is no "list all modules" call, so the sweep walks
 * the range and asks whether each id is initialized; uninitialized ids cost one call and are
 * skipped. Capped rather than unbounded because this runs on the JS thread.
