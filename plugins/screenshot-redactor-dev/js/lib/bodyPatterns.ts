/**
 * Details people type into messages, found by pattern alone.
 *
 * Everything this plugin redacted until now was an *identity field* — the author's name, their
 * avatar, a mention, a badge. None of that touches what people actually wrote, so a screenshot
 * with every name replaced still happily showed "call me on 021 555 1234" or the email address
 * somebody pasted three messages up.
 *
 * This is the free half of fixing that: no key, no network, no AI, running on every row. It is
 * deliberately the same two-tier shape as Second Thoughts — patterns for what patterns can
 * settle, a model only for what they cannot — and the precision lessons are carried over intact:
 * Luhn for card numbers, a snowflake exclusion so Discord ids are not mistaken for phone numbers,
 * and a counting-noun stoplist so "2 hours drive home" is not an address.
 *
 * Precision matters more here than in a send-guard. A false positive in Second Thoughts costs a
 * confirmation tap; a false positive here silently blacks out part of a message in a screenshot
 * the user is about to post, and they may not notice what went missing.
