/**
 * Reading and rewriting what a message actually says.
 *
 * A message's prose lives in `text` content nodes — the same tree `redactContentNodes` walks for
 * mentions, but the plain children rather than the ones carrying a `userId`. This file has the
 * two halves that need: gathering the text so something can judge it, and blanking out runs of it
 * afterwards.
 *
 * ## Substrings, not offsets
 *
 * Redactions are expressed as literal strings to blank out, not as character offsets. The text of
 * one message is spread across however many nodes Discord's parser produced — a link splits a
 * sentence into three — so an offset computed over the joined string does not survive the trip
 * back. Matching substrings per node is immune to that, and has a useful side effect: an email
 * repeated twice in a message is blanked both times.
 *
 * ## Idempotent, like everything else on this path
 *
 * These functions run over rows that may already have been redacted, because `rowManager` and
 * `chatManager` both hook the same data. The block character is never itself a match for anything
 * `findSensitive` returns, so a second pass over redacted text is a no-op.
